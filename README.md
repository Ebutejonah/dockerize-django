# DOCKERIZE-DJANGO

A project that shows how to dockerize a django project. Docker allows our project to be run on different machines say Linux, Windows without complications.
For example, the django-crontab library won't work on a Windows machine but when we dockerize the project and create a linux environment via docker, the django-crontab works seamlessly.
Email verification functionality is also included in this project.
